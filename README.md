# trigger
Trigger is my brainchild project, and it's a small 2D (for now) game engine. It is based on DearPyGui. The goal is for everything in your game to be event based, and you develop the game logic via nodes.
The name trigger comes from the event based priority of this engine. It is designed for small, low overhead games that are mostly, if not all, creatable with event based logic (there is a engine tick node, but I don't recommend using it)
This is an ECS engine, where there are entities, with components.
